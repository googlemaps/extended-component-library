#### Pricing

Note that the SKUs below are only triggered if this component has one or more Place Building Blocks as children that consume Basic/Contact/Atmosphere data. In addition, the SKUs are not triggered if you provide a `Place` or `PlaceResult` object to this component that contains all the data fields necessary to render children's content, or if this component has the `auto-fetch-disabled` attribute.
