# Address Validation

This documentation helps you use pre-built logic for analyzing the API response from the [Address Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation).

> **The Address Validation API is currently available under the [Experimental](https://developers.google.com/maps/launch-stages#experimental) launch stage.** Please be sure to specify `version="alpha"` if using the [API Loader](../api_loader/README.md) component to load the Google Maps JS SDK.

## Prerequisites

* You will need to [enable the Address Validation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/address-validation/cloud-setup#enabling-apis) for your Google Maps Platform project if it is not enabled already.
