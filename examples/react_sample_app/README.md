# React Sample App

This directory contains a simple React app that helps users locate a college in
the US or Canada on a map, with place info such as ratings, photos, and reviews
displayed on the side.

The sample app demonstrates usage of Web Components from both the Maps JS SDK
and the Extended Component Library in a framework-specific setting; notably,
it leverages React wrappers provided by this library to simplify data passing
and event handling.

To view the app from a local dev server, first clone this library from GitHub,
then run the following command from the repository's root directory:

```
MAPS_API_KEY="[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY]" npm run example:react_sample_app
```

Note that this command will build the library locally to incorporate its latest
changes, including those not yet released on NPM.
